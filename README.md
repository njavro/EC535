### Lab4 by Roman (rgva@bu.edu) and Anton (njavro@bu.edu)

We implemented all modes: normal, red-flashing, yellow-flashing.
We can switch between modes using BTN0 and we are able to use BTN1 for pedestrian button.
We also can read data from /dev/mytraffic and can also write into it to change frequency.
We can successfully unload module as well.
